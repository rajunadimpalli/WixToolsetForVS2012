In the Visual Studio 2012 , Microsoft dropped the installer project type and replaced it with an Install Shield project type. So I will share with you my latest installer project using Windows Installer for XML (WIX) tool set.

With this solution, you donâ€™t need to purchase install shield, I have implemented and tested on live production applications without any issues and you know what, earlier installer (old microsoft installer template in VS) used to take 10 to 15 min to install the MSI on production or lower environments, after implementing this installer using WIX toolset , it got reduced to less than 3 min, is it awesome.
